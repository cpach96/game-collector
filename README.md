# game-collector

This is my final Javascript + Rails project called GameCollector! Following my video game oriented projects this project allows the user to input games via form and add them to a growing API collection to build the worlds most expensive gaming collection!! Any user can add or delete data and the javascript will do the work for you on the backend! Thank you for viewing!!
